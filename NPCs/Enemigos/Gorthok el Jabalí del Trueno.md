## Feats
Gorthok is a primal nature spirit that takes the form of a boar as big as an elephant, with lightning that dances along its tusks. Gorthok serves the will of [[Talos]], god of storms, and can be summoned during stormy weather to do the bidding of [[Talos]]'s evil followers. Like its patron deity, Gorthok revels in destruction.
