## [Clockwork amulet](https://5e.tools/items.html#clockwork%20amulet_xge)

- You can use the hat as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
- You can try to cast a cantrip that you don't know. The cantrip must be on the wizard spell list, and you must make a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell. If the check fails, so does the spell, and the action used to cast the spell is wasted. In either case, you can't use this property again until you finish a long rest.

## [Sending Stones](https://5e.tools/items.html#sending%20stones_dmg)
_Sending stones_ come in pairs, with each smooth stone carved to match the other so the pairing is easily recognized. While you touch one stone, you can use an action to cast the [sending](https://5e.tools/spells.html#sending_phb) spell from it. The target is the bearer of the other stone. If no creature bears the other stone, you know that fact as soon as you use the stone and don't cast the spell.

Once [sending](https://5e.tools/spells.html#sending_phb) is cast through the stones, they can't be used again until the next dawn. If one of the stones in a pair is destroyed, the other one becomes nonmagical.
